                    We are a group of people who want to make getting into shoes easier for people,
                    giving them the information on where the shoes are dropping, how much they are going
                    to be, and help determine the amount of hype around them!

                <p>
                    As a group we have always been intrested in the shoe game, new releases, old favorites, and
                    the interworkings of it. In the last couple of years we have become more involved, and want 
                    to get more people involved in it.
