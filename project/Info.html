                        <p>
                            Nike all started with Phil Knight, a middle distance runner and accounting student at the University of Oregon, and Bill Bowerman Phil’s coach. Their love to sports is what brought them together, but they also had a love for technology of sports shoes and apparel. In 1962 Knight finished his studies, and went on a trip around the world. While in Japan, Knight started to importing Japanese running shoes to the United States, only investing $500, and in return had 200 pairs of sneakers in the U.S.

The collaboration has become notable for its sneakers, and the Yeezy Boost sneaker line has been considered one of the most influential sneaker brands in the world. While mostly known for its sneakers, the collaboration also produced shirts, jackets, track pants, socks, women's shoes and their newly released slides.

                        <p>
                            Modern sneaker culture had its roots in the air; that is, the original Air Jordan that released in 1985. Nike, and subsequently the Jordan Brand, has honored this iconic silhouette numerous times since with releases of the Retro 1. The Chicago Bulls used their third overall draft pick on Jordan, a 1982 NCAA champion who would go on to win Olympic gold later in the summer of 1984. Jordan signed a five-year endorsement deal with Nike, reportedly worth $2.5 million (plus royalties), an enormous outlay for an athlete who hadn't yet proven himself on the professional level.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Adidas was founded by Adolf "Adi" Dassler who made sports shoes in his mother's scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach, Germany after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older brother Rudolf joined the business, which became Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory (Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik). The electricity supply in Herzogenaurach was unreliable, so the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment. Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. In 1936, Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his hand made spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics.
